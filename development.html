      <p>Development:
          Html is the standard mark up language for creating web pages and web applications. Html describes the structure of a website to the web browsers. 
          CSS is style sheets language that describes how a website will look. "This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.”
          "Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end framework (library) for designing websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. Unlike many web frameworks, it concerns itself with front-end development only.”
          Javascript enables interactive web sites which makes it a main part of websites. JavaScript is an interpreted programming language at a high-level.
