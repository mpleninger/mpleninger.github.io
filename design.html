      My design process: I devised a plan for how I would tackle my website by visualizing each page and how I wanted them to look. After that I figured out what I info I wanted on each page. Once I had a plan from 30,000 feet above, I jumped in for a better look at the project. I figured out specifics for each page, how many pages total, and more detailed plans for the project. Last I got even closer and started planning what language I would use, the layout of each page, and the functionality of the pages.

      There is no proper way to do the design process. When designing a website or a project you have to stay true to yourself. If you are the type of person that needs to plan everything out on a piece of paper, then do that. If you are someone who does everything in your head do that and then write your process down so someone can make sure that you are going about it the right way. Designing looks different for everyone and what makes a good website is using your strengths to produce something that’s easy to navigate and looks great at the same time.
      
      Design Systems: "A design system is a series of components that can be reused in different combinations. Design systems allow you to manage design at scale.” Design systems are not just style guides. They offer rules, constraints and principles to add distinct functionality to a website or application. Design systems are good for saving time and money. It adds a layer that will make companies more efficient and consistent with their products
